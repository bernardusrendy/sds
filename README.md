# SSICON
A System Dynamic, Simulation, and Intelligent Control Repository
## About
This repository contains my own experiment, the lecture codes, and personally created explanation from TF3101-System Dynamics and Simulation course 
I've taken in Bandung Institute of Technology (Institut Teknologi Bandung) as well as workshops regarding intelligent control and system dynamics.
## Content
Currently the contents are about ANN-PID-Fuzzy Tuning and System dynamics simulation experiment (Linearization of Non-linear first order system)
## Usage
This repository may be used for educational purposes, notes (in case our meatbag brain forgot), summaries, and any other positive things.
## What's Next
This repository will be updated if I've created more explanation regarding the topic
